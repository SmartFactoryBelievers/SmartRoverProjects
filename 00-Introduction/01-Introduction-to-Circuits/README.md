## 1. Introduction to Circuits

A circuit is a complete and closed path around which a circulating electric current can flow.

## 2. Introduction to Resistors
### Resistors
> A **resistor** provides electrical resistance: it limits the flow of the electrons through the circuit.

### Resistors in Parallel
Build the circuit and connect the jumper wires as shown below. The LED will be on but the resistor is limiting the electricity through it.

Turn on the switch to place three other resistors in parallel (notice how they make parallel lines) with the first one. This increases the flow of electricity to the LED and makes it brighter. Placing other resistors in parallel reduces the total resistance.

### Resistors in Series
Build the circuit and connect the jumper wires as shown below. The LED will be on, but the four resistors are limiting the electricity through it.

Turn on the switch to bypass three resistors that are in series with the first one (notice howthey are lined up, one after the other). This increases the flow of electricity to the LED and makes it brighter. Placing other resistors in series increases the total resistance.

## 3. Introduction to Capacitors
> A **capacitor** is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field.

### Two types of capacitors are used in the Smart Rover activities:
> This is a 0.2 microFarad (Î¼F) capacitor

### Capactitors in Parallel
Build the circuit and connect the jumper wires as shown below. Turn the switch on and the LED will turn on. Turn the switch off and the LED will go off slowly.

Electricity stored in the capacitors keeps the LED on after the batteries have been disconnected. If you remove one capacitor, then the LED will turn off faster since less electricity will be stored. If you remove both capacitors, the LED will turn off immediately.

### Capactitors in Series
Build the circuit and connect the jumper wires as shown below. This is the same circuit as above , but with the capacitors connected differently. Turn the switch on and off, and watch how quickly the LED turns off.

The LED doesn't stay on as long with this circuit because capacitors connected in series store less electricity than when in parallel. This is the opposite of how we combined resistors. Capacitors connected in series cannot store as much electricity, but can be used with higher voltages.

## 4. Key Terminology ðŸŽ“

The following are key vocabulary terms associated with circuits and will help students working with the Smart Rover activities. 
> - **Circuit:** the complete path of an electric current including usually the source of electric energy
> - **Resistance:** is a measure in ohms (Î©) of how much a component or circuit resists electrical pressure (voltage) and limits the flow of electric current
> - **Voltage:** electrical pressure exerted by a battery or other power source
> - **Capacitor:** a component that stores an electric charge.
> - **Components:**  individual electrical pieces or pre-designed building blocks used to build the different circuits for each project.
> - **Electricity:** the movement of subatomic charged particles (called electrons) through a material due to electrical pressure across the material, such as from a battery.
> - **Ohms (Î©):** a measure of the electrical resistance of a material or an electrical device
> - **Parallel circuit:** a circuit that includes branches arranged so that the current divides and only part of it flows through any branch.
> - **Series circuit:** a circuit designed with a single path along which the whole current flows through each component

## Tips & Tricks
### :warning: **WARNING** :warning: 
Always check your wiring before turning on a circuit. Never leave a circuit unattended while the batteries are installed. Never connect additional batteries or any other power sources to your circuits. Discard any cracked or broken parts.
- Most circuit problems are due to incorrect assembly, always double-check that your circuit exactly matches the drawing for it. 
- Be sure that parts with positive/negative markings are positioned as per the drawing.
- Be sure that all connections are securely snapped.
- Try replacing the batteries in the Rover body
