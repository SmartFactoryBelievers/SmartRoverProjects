# Introduction to Circuits

Welcome to the "Introduction to Circuits" lesson! This lesson is designed to provide you with a foundational understanding of electrical circuits, which are essential components in various electronic devices and systems.

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will learn about:
- The basic concepts of electricity and circuits
- The different types of circuit components and their functions
- How to build and analyze simple circuits

## Key Concepts

### Electricity and Circuits
- **Electricity**: The flow of electric charge, typically measured in amperes (A).
- **Circuit**: A closed loop that allows electricity to flow from a power source, through various components, and back to the source.

### Circuit Components
- **Resistors**: Components that resist the flow of electric current, measured in ohms (Î©).
- **Capacitors**: Components that store and release electrical energy, measured in farads (F).
- **Inductors**: Components that store energy in a magnetic field, measured in henries (H).
- **Power Sources**: Devices that provide electrical energy, such as batteries or power supplies.

### Building and Analyzing Circuits
- **Series Circuits**: Circuits where components are connected end-to-end, so the current flows through each component sequentially.
- **Parallel Circuits**: Circuits where components are connected across common points, so the current can flow through multiple paths.
- **Ohm's Law**: A fundamental principle that relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in a circuit: V = I * R.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
1. Explain the basic principles of electricity and how circuits work.
2. Identify and describe the functions of common circuit components.
3. Construct simple series and parallel circuits.
4. Apply Ohm's Law to analyze and solve circuit problems.
