## 1. Project 08: Introduction to Camera
### About Project 08
:sparkles: **Objective:** To learn about the camera and different image settings.

In this project, you will learn about different image settings.

### Required Components
Smart Module

### Instructions
1. First, connect your Smart Module to a monitor.
> :pencil2: There is no circuit to build for this project, as we will be introducing the camera within the Smart Module.
2. Once connected, open up Thonny and load Project08_IntroductionToCamera.py into the code editor.
3. Once you have completed the program, run it to experiment with the camera.

> :information_source: Connecting a monitor via the HDMI cable provided in the Smart Rover kit is the quickest and easiest way to view the output of the Raspberry Pi in the Smart Module. It is possible to connect the Raspberry Pi to a laptop by creating a Virtual Network Connection (VNC) but this is a more advanced approach and should be utilized only if an HDMI-compatiable monitor is not available.

### Project 08 Code Challenges
Once you have the program running correctly, try the following challenges:

:one: Try changing the camera resolution to the minimum (64,64 and framerate = 15) and see what the image looks like. 

:two: Try changing the camera resolution to the maximum (2592,1944 and framerate = 15) and see what the image looks like. 

:three: Try changing the camera rotation to flip it.

:four: Try adding text on top of the image.

:five: Try looping through all the contrast and brightness options, with annotations on the image of the current level.

## 2. Key Terminology
The following are key vocabulary terms associated with the Smart Rover Project 08.  The key terms will help support you as you navigate the rover activity. 
- **Resolution:** Clarity of an image
- **Frame Rate:** Recording speed
- **Contrast:** Luminance between objects
- **Brightness:** Lightness

## 3. Project 08 Troubleshooting

### Solution Code
If you need to debug your code, please refer to the [Project 08 Solution Code](../Resources/Solutions/Project08_IntroductionToCamera_Solution.py)

## Tips & Tricks
### :warning: **WARNING** :warning: 
Always check your wiring before turning on a circuit. Never leave a circuit unattended while the batteries are installed. Never connect additional batteries or any other power sources to your circuits. Discard any cracked or broken parts.
- Most circuit problems are due to incorrect assembly, always double-check that your circuit exactly matches the drawing for it especially the direction of arrows on the circuits. 
- Be sure that parts with positive/negative markings are positioned as per the build diagram.
- Be sure that all connections are securely snapped.
- Try replacing the batteries in the Rover body
