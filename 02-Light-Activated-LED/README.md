## 1. Project 02: Light Activated LED

### About Project 2
:sparkles: **Objective:** To control the LED light with a push button

In this project, students will extend what's learned in activity one by adding to the previously built circuit and altering the Python code to add controls to the program.

### Required Components:
Smart Module, Press Switch (S2), LED (D4, D8, or D12), 3 snap connector (3), 2 snap connectors (2) x 2, horn (W1), photoresistor (Q4)

### Instructions
1. First, connect the Smart Module to your laptop or monitor.
2. Then build the circuit as shown below.  Ensure arrows on the snap circuits flow in the same direction as the video and images. 
3. Once the circuit is created, open up Thonny and load Project02.py into the code editor. 
4. Once you have completed the program, upload it the to the rover and use the switch to blink the LED.

> ℹ️Connecting a monitor via the HDMI cable provided in the Smart Rover kit is the quickest and easiest way to view the output of the Raspberry Pi in the Smart Module. It is possible to connect the Raspberry Pi to a laptop by creating a Virtual Network Connection (VNC) but this is a more advanced approach and should be utilized only if an HDMI-compatiable monitor is not available.

### Project 2 Build Video

### Project 02 Challenges
:one: Try changing the LED variables to change the blinking pattern.
:two: Replace the LED with the horn (W1) or a different LED to try different outputs.
:three: Replace the push button with the phototransistor and cover it with your hand. What happens?  Note that the phototransistor should be installed with the + on the left.

## 2. Key Terminology
The following are key vocabulary terms associated with the Smart Rover activity 2.  The key terms will help support you as you navigate the rover activity. 
- **Input:** the signals or data received by a computer system
- **Output:** the signals or data sent from a computer system.

## 3. Project 02 Troubleshooting

### Solution Code
If you need to debug your code, please refer to the [Project 02 Solution Code](../Resources/Solutions/Project02_LightActivatedLED_Solution.py)

## Tips & Tricks
### :warning: **WARNING** :warning: 
Always check your wiring before turning on a circuit. Never leave a circuit unattended while the batteries are installed. Never connect additional batteries or any other power sources to your circuits. Discard any cracked or broken parts.
- Most circuit problems are due to incorrect assembly, always double-check that your circuit exactly matches the drawing for it. Especially the direction of the arrows on the snap circuits. 
- Be sure that parts with positive/negative markings are positioned as per the build diagram.
- Be sure that all connections are securely snapped.
- Try replacing the batteries in the Rover body
