## 1. Project 04: Programmed Driving
### About Project 04
:sparkles: **Objective:** To program the rover to drive in a coded path

In this project, you will learn about motor control outputs and create driving functions.

### Required Components
Smart Module, Rover, Motor Control (U8), 1KΩ Resistor (x4), connector wiring (all colors), 3 snap connector (3), 2 snap connector (2) x 2.

### Instructions
1. First, connect your Smart Module to a monitor. 
2. Add batteries to the Smart Rover (for all projects involving the Smart Rover loading batteries is required)
3. Build snap circuit from the diagram.  Note:  You may want to build the circuitry without the snap tray in order to ensure secure connections with the snap connectors.  
4. Once the circuit is created, open up Thonny and load Project04.py into the code editor.
5. Once you have completed the circuit, run the program to drive it along your designated path.

> :information_source: Connecting a monitor via the HDMI cable provided in the Smart Rover kit is the quickest and easiest way to view the output of the Raspberry Pi in the Smart Module. It is possible to connect the Raspberry Pi to a laptop by creating a Virtual Network Connection (VNC) but this is a more advanced approach and should be utilized only if an HDMI-compatiable monitor is not available.

### Project 04 Code Challenges
Once you have the program running correctly, try the following challenges:

:one: Try changing the drive function time arguments to alter the driving path.

:two: Reorder the drive functions for a new driving path.

:three: Create your own custom driving path using the different drive functions and time arguments.

## 2. Key Terminology
The following are key vocabulary terms associated with the Smart Rover Project 03.  The key terms will help support you as you navigate the rover activity. 
- **Functions**: a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.
- **Motor Control Module:** contains 16 transistors and resistors that are needed to control the motors of the rover.
- **Rover body:** has both motors that convert electrical energy into mechanical motion and a battery.

## 3. Project 04 Troubleshooting

### Solution Code
If you need to debug your code, please refer to the [Project 04 Solution Code](../Resources/Solutions/Project04_ProgrammedDriving_Solution.py)

## Tips & Tricks
### :warning: **WARNING** :warning: 
Always check your wiring before turning on a circuit. Never leave a circuit unattended while the batteries are installed. Never connect additional batteries or any other power sources to your circuits. Discard any cracked or broken parts.
- Most circuit problems are due to incorrect assembly, always double-check that your circuit exactly matches the drawing for it especially the direction of arrows on the circuits. 
- Be sure that parts with positive/negative markings are positioned as per the build diagram.
- Be sure that all connections are securely snapped.
- Try replacing the batteries in the Rover body
