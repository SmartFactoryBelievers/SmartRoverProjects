# The Smart Rover Projects
To foster the next generation of believers, The Smart Factory @ Wichita has partnered with Elenco® Electronics to produce a new STEM
education product: the Smart Rover. The Smart Rover kit includes Elenco® Electronics’ award-winning Snap Circuits® products and adds
a new component, the Smart Module. Assembled in a custom-designed housing produced and assembled live at The Smart Factory @
Wichita, the module holds a Raspberry Pi microcomputer and camera.

The projects within the Smart Rover kit begin with teaching the basics of computer programming on the Raspberry Pi and explore all
the way up to enabling the rover to self-drive and “see” using the embedded camera. But innovation does not end with the last page of
this booklet. The Smart Rover kit seeks to empower all students, across all ages, with the enduring skills needed to design, code, and
build for the future.
