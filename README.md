# The Smart Rover Projects
To foster the next generation of believers, The Smart Factory @ Wichita has partnered with Elenco¬Æ Electronics to produce a new STEM
education product: the Smart Rover. The Smart Rover kit includes Elenco¬Æ Electronics‚Äô award-winning Snap Circuits¬Æ products and adds
a new component, the Smart Module. Assembled in a custom-designed housing produced and assembled live at The Smart Factory @
Wichita, the module holds a Raspberry Pi microcomputer and camera.

The projects within the Smart Rover kit begin with teaching the basics of computer programming on the Raspberry Pi and explore all
the way up to enabling the rover to self-drive and ‚Äúsee‚Äù using the embedded camera. But innovation does not end with the last page of
this booklet. The Smart Rover kit seeks to empower all students, across all ages, with the enduring skills needed to design, code, and
build for the future.

## Project Progression
The introductory projects will teach the basics of programming, as well as circuitry, using both the Raspberry Pi within the Smart
Module and various components, including the LED light, the horn, the phototransistor, and the selector. Next, you will learn about
motor controls and how to program the rover to drive. Finally, we will use the camera within the Smart Module to detect color and light,
then incorporate those inputs into driving. All the projects have a starting program file pre-loaded to the Raspberry Pi. A code
reference guide for all projects is available on The Smart Factory @ Wichita website.

Please note that not all possible kit components are included in the projects. These include: the Programmable Fan, the Speaker,
and the NPN Transistor. However, using the concepts introduced in the projects will allow you to incorporate all possible components.

## Each lesson includes:

üìñ README file containing Introduction, circuit diagram, code challenges, and more

üêç Python code script (which is also pre-loaded onto the Smart Module)

üé• Code-along videos with line-by-line instructions

üîó Links to additional resources and troubleshooting tips

## Hardware
The Smart Rover uses building blocks with snaps to build the different circuits for each project. Each component has a different
function and is colored so you can identify it. Each component easily snaps together so you can build the circuit. 

> üíÅ You can read more [about the components](Resources/about-the-components.pdf) and find a [list of what's included](Resources/snap-circuit-components.png) in your Smart Rover Kit in the [Resources folder](Resources/README.md)!

## Installation
To use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on your own, starting with reading the lesson content in the README files and completing the rest of the activities. Try to complete the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Click here to create your own copy of this repository: [![Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fork%20this%20repo-green?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/SmartFactoryBelievers/SmartRoverProjects/fork)
2. Open a terminal on your Smart Module by clicking this icon in the top left menu bar: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a323731a-4304-48fa-ac3e-df3e7e939355)
3. In the terminal navigate to the Projects Folder on your Smart Module: `cd Desktop/Projects`
4. Copy the HTTPS link to your forked repository: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66524c1b-4dce-4096-8058-36757f0cbda6)
5. Clone the repository: `git clone <paste your link here>`
6. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SmartRoverProjects`
7. Install the required dependencies: `python pip install -r requirements.txt`
8. Now, you are ready to begin! Keep this GitHub page open on your Smart Module browser to review the lesson content alongside your code in the Thonny IDE.
> :white_check_mark: Don't forget to save your changes often! We recommend creating a new branch each time you work on the code using the following command:
> 
> `git checkout -b <your-name-today's-date>`
> 
> Then, make your edits directly in the python project code files in Thonny IDE and save the files. Once you reach a stopping point, run the following commands to update your repository in GitHub:
> 
> `git add . `
> 
> `git commit -m "a short description of the change"`
> 
> `git push`
