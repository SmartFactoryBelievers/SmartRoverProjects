## 1. Project 01: Blinking LED
### About Project 01

:sparkles: **Objective:** To learn programming basics and make the LED light blink

In this project, students will learn about setting up their program, creating variables, and creating loops. Students will build a simple circuit to demonstrate their program.

This activity will introduce students to the basics of programming in Python using the Thonny Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This will allow students to modify the pre-loaded programs. Students will use Thonny in future activities to connect these skills to future skills.

### Required Components
Smart Module, LED (D4, D8, or D12), 100Ω Resistor (R1), 3 snap connector (3), horn (W1)

### Instructions
1. First, connect your Smart Module to a monitor or to a laptop (See note below).
2. Build the circuit as shown in the picture below.  Ensure the arrow on the LED (D4) matches the direction in the video and diagram. 
3. Once the circuit is created, open up Thonny and load Project01.py into the code editor. The pre-loaded programs are ready to run, but you will learn by reviewing the language and completing the challenges.
4. Once you have completed the program, start the program by clicking the RUN button in Thonny to blink the LED.

> :information_source: Connecting a monitor via the HDMI cable provided in the Smart Rover kit is the quickest and easiest way to view the output of the Raspberry Pi in the Smart Module. It is possible to connect the Raspberry Pi to a laptop by creating a Virtual Network Connection (VNC) but this is a more advanced approach and should be utilized only if an HDMI-compatiable monitor is not available.

### Project 01 Code-along Video

### Project 01 Code Challenges
Once you have the program running correctly, try the following challenges:

:one: **Challenge 1:** Try changing the LED variables to change the blinking pattern.

:two: **Challenge 2:** Replace the LED with the horn (W1) or a different LED to try different outputs.

## 2. Key Terminology
The following are key vocabulary terms associated with the Smart Rover Project 01.  The key terms will help support you as you navigate the rover activity. 
- Code Comment: a line of code that is not executed but included by the programmer to explain what is happening in the program.
- Libraries: helpful modules with prewritten code blocks that can be reused to save time and effort in programming
- Variables: words or phrases we can set as equal to specific values or locations so we use them later, reducing complexity.
- Loop: a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met.
- `For` Loop: a loop that runs for a fixed number of times.
- `While` Loop: a loop that will continue to run until the set condition changes.

## 3. Project 01 Troubleshooting

### Solution Code
If you need to debug your code, please refer to the [Project 01 Solution Code](../Resources/Solutions/Project01_BlinkingLED_Solution.py)

## Tips & Tricks
### :warning: **WARNING** :warning: 
Always check your wiring before turning on a circuit. Never leave a circuit unattended while the batteries are installed. Never connect additional batteries or any other power sources to your circuits. Discard any cracked or broken parts.
- Most circuit problems are due to incorrect assembly, always double-check that your circuit exactly matches the drawing for it especially the direction of arrows on the circuits. 
- Be sure that parts with positive/negative markings are positioned as per the build diagram.
- Be sure that all connections are securely snapped.
- Try replacing the batteries in the Rover body
